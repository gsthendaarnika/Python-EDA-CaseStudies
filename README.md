# 🧠 Python EDA Case Studies  

This repository is a collection of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** case studies performed using **Python**.  
Each notebook explores real-world datasets to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand relationships within data through visualization and statistical analysis.

## 📂 Case Studies Included

### 1. 🎬 Correlation in Python – Movie Dataset  
- **Objective:** Explore how numerical features like budget, revenue, and ratings are correlated.  
- **Techniques:** Correlation matrices, pair plots, and heatmaps for identifying relationships.  
- **Skills:** Data visualization, statistical reasoning, and feature interpretation.

---

### 2. 🌍 EDA – World Population  
- **Objective:** Analyze global population growth and demographic trends across continents.  
- **Techniques:** Data grouping, trend visualization, and comparative analysis.  
- **Skills:** Aggregation, data storytelling, and handling time-series-like population data.
